TOYOTA CAR SHOWCASE APP - PRESENTATION SCRIPT

Introduction:
"Good morning/afternoon. Today I'll be presenting my Toyota Car Showcase application, which I developed using Android native technologies. This app provides users with detailed information about Toyota's 2024 model lineup."

Key Features:

1. Welcome Experience:
"When users first launch the app, they're greeted with a professional splash screen featuring the Toyota logo on a black background. This creates a premium feel right from the start. Following this, a welcome dialog appears that introduces users to the app's features."

2. Main Interface:
"The main screen displays a clean, modern list of Toyota vehicles. Each car is presented in a card format showing:
- High-quality images of each vehicle
- Model name and year
- Starting price
This layout ensures easy navigation and quick access to information."

3. Interactive Features:
"Each car card has two main interaction points:
- A 'Show More' button that expands the card to reveal quick specifications
- Clicking the car image opens a detailed view with comprehensive information"

4. Detailed Car Information:
"The detailed view for each car is organized into clear sections:
- Overview with key specifications
- Driver Hub features showing entertainment and connectivity options
- Comprehensive feature list
This ensures users can easily find the information they're looking for."

5. User Experience Enhancements:
"I've implemented several features to improve user experience:
- Material Design 3 theming for modern aesthetics
- Dark mode toggle for comfortable viewing in any lighting
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive layout that works on various screen sizes"

Technical Implementation:
"The app is built using:
- Native Android with Kotlin
- Material Design 3 components
- RecyclerView for efficient list handling
- XML layouts for precise UI control
- Shared Preferences for theme persistence"

Conclusion:
